# Diatomic Chain
This is an interactive visualisation of the diatomic chain model in condensed matter physics. In particular, this is the version in which two atoms of different mass are connected by identical springs. At the bottom of the page is the dispersion plot for the diatomic chain for atoms of mass M and 2M. This can be clicked in order to animate the relevant modes above. In addition, one can add or subtract a reciprocal lattice vector and observe how the motion of the atoms is unchanged.

Of particular interest are the modes at k = 0 and k = +/- pi / a , where a is the unit cell repeat distance. At this value of k, some atoms are stationary whilst others move, depending on the branch observed.
